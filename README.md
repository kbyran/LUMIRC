#  Laplacian-Uniform Mixture-Driven Iterative Robust Coding With Applications to Face Recognition Against Dense Errors

### Introduction

This is the original **MATLAB** implementation for our TNNLS paper, ***Laplacian-Uniform Mixture-Driven Iterative Robust Coding With Applications to Face Recognition Against Dense Errors***.

The MATLAB source codes for EYB experiments and AR experiments can be found in Occlusion&Corruption_experiment folder and Real_disguise&Corruption_experiment folder, corresponding to SectionIV-B and SectionIV-C in our paper, respectively.  Although we have no right to share them directly, test datasets can be publicly accessed via Internet. The test data will require certain pre-processing and the source codes will require modification according to how you structure your data. Details can be found in our paper.
